# LIDCIterativeClustering
Code for Iterative Clustering for Subtype Discovery on the LIDC. 
Written by Katherine Aubert and Catherine Huber.
Both .py files and .ipynb files are added for your convenience! We use Google Drive functionality in order to mount files from our Drive, so you may want to run this in Google Colaboratory so that you are able to mount Drive files. 
The only necessary file you will need to run this is the LIDC Max Slices Per Nodule .csv file in this repository.
